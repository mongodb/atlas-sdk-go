# Go SDK Release Pipeline

## Context

Please refer to the [end user versioning guide](https://github.com/mongodb/atlas-sdk-go/blob/main/docs/doc_1_concepts.md#release-strategy-semantic-versioning)

## Release steps

Release is done as part of the 2 steps:

1. Automatic bump as part of the OpenAPI generation process that creates API bot update PR.
2. Release tag when update PR is merged

## Disabling automatic release

In situations where we do not want to perform automatic release please remove changes from `./internal/core/version.go` file.

## Manual Minor Release

Manual release is possible by updating `./internal/core/version.go` file with minor version bump.

## Manual Major Release

For major releases (breaking changes) introduced outside new Resource Version.

1. Run `make update-version` command
2. Provide list of breaking changes in [BREAKING_CHANGES.md]([end user versioning guide](https://github.com/mongodb/atlas-sdk-go/blob/main/BREAKING_CHANGES.md)

## Automation Process Internals
