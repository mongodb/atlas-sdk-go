# Go SDK Release Pipeline

## Context

Please refer to the [end user versioning guide](https://github.com/mongodb/atlas-sdk-go/blob/main/docs/doc_1_concepts.md#release-strategy-semantic-versioning)

## Release steps

The release is done as part of the 2 steps:

1. Automatic bump as part of the OpenAPI generation process that creates API bot update PR.
2. Release tag when update PR is merged

## Disabling automatic release

In situations where we do not want to perform automatic release please remove changes from `./internal/core/version.go` file.

## Manual Minor Release

Manual release is possible by updating `./internal/core/version.go` file with minor version bump.

## Manual Major Release

For major releases (breaking changes) introduced outside new Resource Version.

1. Run `make update-version` command
2. Provide list of breaking changes in [BREAKING_CHANGES.md]([end user versioning guide](https://github.com/mongodb/atlas-sdk-go/blob/main/BREAKING_CHANGES.md)

## Automation Process Internals

Automation reads Resource Version in the `version.go` file and in the OpenAPI `versions.json`

### New Resource Version

For the new Resource Version introduced in the versions.json

- Reset the minor version
- Replace all occurrences of the Major version in the repository
- Update versions in versions.go

### New Generation

- Issue new Minor release
- Update versions in versions.go

### Manual Breaking Changes Release

- Read versions in versions.go
- Automatically bump the Major version in versions.go
- Replace all occurrences of the Major version in the repository

## Release Notes

If the release contains breaking changes (it is a major release)
we should provide a list of breaking changes notes under `./breaking _changes/{major_version}.md` file.
This file is automatically generated during release.

## Folder structure

`./scripts` - release scripts. Please do not edit them without testing them on the fork repository.
`./breaking_changes` - folder containing a list of breaking changes. It is generally safe to prune old files in that folder as values are used during the release.
