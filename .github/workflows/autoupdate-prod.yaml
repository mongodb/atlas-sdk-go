            Automatic update for MongoDB Atlas Go Client based on OpenAPI changes.
            PR contains autogenerated changes for the MongoDB Atlas client.
            
            ## Automated checks

            1. Compilation and unit tests
            2. Documentation style
            3. Transformation engine linting

            ## Important Details

            1. If build is failing please check the logs and fix the issues in the OpenAPI file (openapi/atlas-api.yaml)
            2. Do not attempt to manually fix any issues in the Golang Codebase as all changes are automatically generated. 
            Fixes should be applied to the OpenAPI file (openapi/atlas-api.yaml) or ./tools engine in separate PR.

            ## Manual Review Procedure

            1. Review changes in the OpenAPI file (openapi/atlas-api.yaml)
            2. Do we see any breaking changes? Renames in methods or models that will affect customers.
            3. If we see any breaking changes please:
              - Manually edit version.go file and bump the version to the next major version
              - Add required Release Notes to the CHANGELOG.md file
              - Add a comment to the PR with the description of the breaking change
            3. Merge PR into main branch 
            4. After merge automated release process will be triggered.
