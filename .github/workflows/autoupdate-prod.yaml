            Automatic update for MongoDB Atlas Go Client based on OpenAPI changes.
            PR contains autogenerated changes for the MongoDB Atlas client.
            
            ## Automated checks

            1. Compilation and unit tests
            2. Documentation style
            3. Transformation engine linting

            > NOTE: New automation PRs need to be closed and reopened to trigger builds

            ## Important Details

            1. If the build is failing please check the logs and fix the issues in the OpenAPI file (openapi/atlas-api.yaml)
            2. Do not attempt to manually fix any issues in the Golang code as all changes are automatically generated. 
            Fixes should be applied to the OpenAPI file (openapi/atlas-api.yaml) or ./tools engine in a separate PR.

            ## Manual Review Procedure

            1. Review changes in the OpenAPI file (openapi/atlas-api.yaml)
            2. Review breaking changes information in generated `./releaser/breaking_changes/{release_version}.md` file
            3. Merge PR into the main branch 
            4. After the merge automated release process will be triggered.
