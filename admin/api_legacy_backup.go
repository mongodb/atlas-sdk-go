		CreateClusterRestoreJob Create One Legacy Backup Restore Job

		Restores one legacy backup for one cluster in the specified project. To use this resource, the requesting Service Account or API Key must have the Project Owner role. Effective 23 March 2020, all new clusters can use only Cloud Backups. When you upgrade to 4.2, your backup system upgrades to cloud backup if it is currently set to legacy backup. After this upgrade, all your existing legacy backup snapshots remain available. They expire over time in accordance with your retention policy. Your backup policy resets to the default schedule. If you had a custom backup policy in place with legacy backups, you must re-create it with the procedure outlined in the Cloud Backup documentation. This endpoint doesn't support creating checkpoint restore jobs for sharded clusters, or creating restore jobs for queryable backup snapshots. If you create an automated restore job by specifying `delivery.methodName` of `AUTOMATED_RESTORE` in your request body, MongoDB Cloud removes all existing data on the target cluster prior to the restore.

		@param groupId Unique 24-hexadecimal digit string that identifies your project. Use the [/groups](#tag/Projects/operation/listProjects) endpoint to retrieve all projects to which the authenticated user has access.  **NOTE**: Groups and projects are synonymous terms. Your group id is the same as your project id. For existing groups, your group/project id remains the same. The resource and corresponding endpoints use the term groups.
		@param clusterName Human-readable label that identifies the cluster with the snapshot you want to return.

ListClusterRestoreJobs Return All Legacy Backup Restore Jobs

Returns all legacy backup restore jobs for one cluster in the specified project. To use this resource, the requesting Service Account or API Key must have the Project Read Only role.

	Effective 23 March 2020, all new clusters can use only Cloud Backups. When you upgrade to 4.2, your backup system upgrades to cloud backup if it is currently set to legacy backup. After this upgrade, all your existing legacy backup snapshots remain available. They expire over time in accordance with your retention policy. Your backup policy resets to the default schedule. If you had a custom backup policy in place with legacy backups, you must re-create it with the procedure outlined in the Cloud Backup documentation. If you use the `BATCH-ID` query parameter, you can retrieve all restore jobs in the specified batch. When creating a restore job for a sharded cluster, MongoDB Cloud creates a separate job for each shard, plus another for the config server. Each of those jobs are part of a batch. However, a batch can't include a restore job for a replica set.

	@param ctx context.Context - for authentication, logging, cancellation, deadlines, tracing, etc. Passed from http.Request or context.Background().
	@param groupId Unique 24-hexadecimal digit string that identifies your project. Use the [/groups](#tag/Projects/operation/listProjects) endpoint to retrieve all projects to which the authenticated user has access.  **NOTE**: Groups and projects are synonymous terms.

/*
UpdateClusterSnapshotSchedule Update Snapshot Schedule for One Cluster

Updates the snapshot schedule for one cluster in the specified project. To use this resource, the requesting Service Account or API Key must have the Project Owner role.

	Effective 23 March 2020, all new clusters can use only Cloud Backups. When you upgrade to 4.2, your backup system upgrades to cloud backup if it is currently set to legacy backup. After this upgrade, all your existing legacy backup snapshots remain available. They expire over time in accordance with your retention policy. Your backup policy resets to the default schedule. If you had a custom backup policy in place with legacy backups, you must re-create it with the procedure outlined in the Cloud Backup documentation.

	@param ctx context.Context - for authentication, logging, cancellation, deadlines, tracing, etc. Passed from http.Request or context.Background().
	@param groupId Unique 24-hexadecimal digit string that identifies your project. Use the [/groups](#tag/Projects/operation/listProjects) endpoint to retrieve all projects to which the authenticated user has access.  **NOTE**: Groups and projects are synonymous terms. Your group id is the same as your project id. For existing groups, your group/project id remains the same. The resource and corresponding endpoints use the term groups.
	@param clusterName Human-readable label that identifies the cluster with the snapshot you want to return.
	@return UpdateClusterSnapshotScheduleApiRequest

Deprecated
